## Motivation:
### What is it?
The project being created is a **study-help platform** geared towards assisting:
- those stuck solving a question and want an explained solution
- those wanting specific textbook questions answered

### What problem does it solve?
Making study-help **more accessible** to everyone by giving **detailed answers** for **free**.

### Why it exists?
Some students need some extra help with certain questions or types of questions but may not have:
- the access to instructors
- the money to pay for a tutor or study-help service

We have created a **free** alternative.
